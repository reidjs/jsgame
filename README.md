VERSION
God Simulator
1. Initialize Life
2. Answer Prayers (missions)
3. These cause further problems
4. Collect currency (faith)
5. Use faith to expand your following
6. Persuade your followers to commit horrible, horrible atrocities
7. Assign jobs to followers -
Clergy (Give Faith)
Builder builds
Woodsman (chops wood )
Farmer (grows food)
followers gain skills in certain jobs to make them 'stick' to that job.
followers gain bonuses and ailments (positive and negative) based on their work, hunger, and quests
ex: hunger > 100 roll a die every turn to determine if they suffer malnourishment: (works at half the speed of others)
build a farm: increase exp in building which gives opportunity to roll certain positive traits like...
Master Builder: Buildings built by this person provide double their normal output
have a child: roll a die for mother death, roll for 'extra fertile' gene which allows pregnancy in half the original TIME_TIL_BIRTH
chop wood: increase exp in axe which can roll positive traits like...
Experienced Woodsman: Gathers wood at double speed,
but accidents happen too, Broken Limb: Woodsman broke his leg and cannot work for 5 turns

Use faith to reverse ailments strategically - e.g., fix the woodsman if you are making a large building

Risk and Reward: Grand projects like churches, altars, etc. have the potential to bring big faith rewards, but
these large projects may require you to put your followers in harms way. As long as you have a man and a woman your town
can live on.
You risk your followers by grouping and outfitting them [armor, weapons, powers, loot] and sending them on quests
the goal is to build balanced groups (healer, tank, ranger, missionary) and having them go coerce other
societies into believing you. Their success is passive after being outfitted because they leave your 'influence'
generally they will return (sometimes they will die) with ailments and bonuses based on the quest profile and their
initial properties and skills. They can sometimes bring back loot and other followers.

loot are passive skill boosting objects

Consider removing the phaser stuff.
